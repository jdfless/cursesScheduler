This command-line interface (CLI) written in python using the curses library was one of the final projects in my degree from OSU. It gave me some great experience in writing code from a library I had never used before as well as trying to design a user friendly UI with very limited tools.  The professor did not teach or lecture in this class (by design), he instead served only as the client for this project, giving non-technical responses to questions about what was needed in the CLI.

The CLI was written entirely by me in December of 2015.  Please read the report for a much more detailed look at the program as well as some screenshots of the program in action.
